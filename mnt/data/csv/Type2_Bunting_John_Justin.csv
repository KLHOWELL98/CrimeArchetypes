We looked on the library website on LexisNexis, Criminal Justice Abstracts and Periodicals, and Newspaper Source Plus. We also searched for books in the library about John Bunting but there were none. We also searched some search engines on the web and most articles that came up were just about the hearings.  All of the above did not have sufficient or any information about John Bunting. 
**N/A= No information was able to be found. 
Areas where we had trouble finding information on John Bunting: 
	1.Some of his childhood and family relations i.e. Parent’s occupation. 
2.We could not find anything on Bunting psychological information, there was nothing mentioned 	about previous crimes, but we don’t know if there just was not any information about it. 
3.Location of killings were not found for Barry Lane and Garry O’Dwyer, 
4.We were not able to find the dates of the murders of Gavin Porter, Gary O’Dwyer."
