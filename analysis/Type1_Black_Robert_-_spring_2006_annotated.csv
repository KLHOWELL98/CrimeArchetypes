1952,5 yrs.,"Jack Tulip died. Black claims to have no memory of him, indeed, no memories at all before the age of five. Although locals remember how Robert Black was frequently heavily bruised as a boy, Black himself cannot recall how he got these injuries.  He recalls no abusive behavior from Jack, though he does remember how Margaret used to lock him in the house as a punishment for bad behavior, or alternatively, pull down his trousers and underwear and spank him with a belt. At nights Robbie was scared that there was a monster under his bed waiting to get him, and used to suffer from a recurring nightmare featuring a 'big hairy monster' in a cellar full of water. When he awoke he frequently found that he had wet the bed, which invariably provoked a beating. To his classmates at primary school Robert - or 'Smelly Robbie Tulip' as he was known - is remembered as having been an aggressive and slightly wayward boy. Having said this, in the period that he was living with the Tulips, Robert never really got himself into any serious trouble: he had childish fights, played up at school, and bullied the younger children, yet he seemed to avoid anything more serious than a rebuke from Williams for swearing in front of ladies.
